I decided for my Data Analysis course that I had done through the University of College Dublin, I would analyze the Indian Premier League. I'm a big sport guy, and a
big fan of the IPL. The data source I wanted to analyze, was the auction data for the teams over the last 10 editions, 2013 to 2022.  

I found the data on Kaggle (kaggle.com/datasets). During the course I was exposed to Pandas, Matlib and Seaborn, learning how to manipulate data and vizualize it. 

The course also wanted us either Webscrape data, using a API or link to the data, or import data from a SQL database. I started investigating this and found that Microsoft Azure had a trial option of 2 months. I would have the option of creating cloud-based SQL database. 

I created a Azure SQL Server. I was easy enough to do this, but I had to use Google to ensure that I'm doing it correctly. 

The SQL server contained a database of 11 tables, each table had the standings for the year. The 11th table was the team identifier table.
The tables would show the team id, their position, how many games they won, lost, tied and the no results (rained out). 
I unfortunately couldn't include the SQL version as my trial expired and as a result I had to change my code to include a second Excel file. 

The Excel file has 11 sheets, the same as the SQL server. 10 standings tables and one identifier sheet.  

I really enjoyed applying everything I learned. The best learning was running into a problem or piece of code that didn't do what I had expected and Googling to find a
solution.
