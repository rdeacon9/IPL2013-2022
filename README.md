I completed a Data Analysis course provided by the University of College Dublin. For the project needed to complete the course, I decided to analyze data relating to the Indian Premier League. This idea was inspired by my love for sport, and in particular the IPL. The data source I wanted to analyze was the auction data for the teams over the last 10 editions, namely 2013 to 2022.  

I found the data on Kaggle (kaggle.com/datasets). During the course I was exposed to Pandas, Matlib and Seaborn, learning how to manipulate data and vizualize it. 

The course also wanted us to either Webscrape data, using an API or link to the data, or import data from a SQL database. I started investigating this and found that Microsoft Azure had a trial option of 2 months. With this I would have the option of creating cloud-based SQL database. 

I was able to create an Azure SQL Server, with some help along the way from Google. The SQL server contained a database of 11 tables, 10 of which had the standings for one of the respective years. The 11th table was the team identifier table.
The tables would show the team id, their position, how many games they won, lost, tied and the 'no results' (games that were rained out). 

I unfortunately couldn't include the SQL version as my trial expired and as a result I had to change my code to include a second Excel file. 
The Excel file has 11 sheets, the same as the SQL server. 10 standing sheets and one identifier sheet.  

I really enjoyed applying everything I learned. I learnt the most when I ran into a problem or piece of code that didn't do what I had expected, and I needed to investigate and troubleshoot it to find a solution.
